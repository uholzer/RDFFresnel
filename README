===================================
  RDF Fresnel Renderer for RDFLib
===================================

IMPORTANT: File formats and interfaces are not yet stable! Significant
changes to the Python interface and the XML output will be made!

RDFFresnel is a partial implementation of Fresnel[1] on top of
RDFLib[2]. It supports SPARQL selectors, but not FSL selectors. Some
enhancements beyond [1] have been added.

Requirements:
- Python 3
- rdflib
- rdflib-sparql
- lxml

Recommended:
- Any XSLT 1.0 processor (for example xsltproc[3])

Installation:
    python3 setup.py install
If you want to install to your home directory instead, use
    python3 setup.py install --user

Usage of the command line tool rdffresnel-render:
    rdffresnel-render --instances stuff.rdf \
                      --lenses lenses.n3 --lenses-format n3 \
                      http://example.org/thing > out.xml

You likely want to transform the output with an XSLT processor using
one of the stylesheets shipped with this package. By default they are
installed in /usr/local/share/RDFFresnel/transforms or
~/.local/share/RDFFresnel/transforms. For example:
    xsltproc /usr/local/share/RDFFresnel/transforms/fresneltoxhtml5.xsl \
             out.xml > final.xhtml

Usage of the library:
    import rdflib
    from RDFFresnel import Context, ContainerBox

    # A graph containing the lenses and one containing instance data
    fresnelGraph = rdflib.Graph()
    instanceGraph = rdflib.Graph()
    
    # Fill graphs with triples
    ...

    # Create an initial context
    ctx = Context(fresnelGraph=fresnelGraph, instanceGraph=instanceGraph)

    # A container which holds rendered resources
    box = ContainerBox(ctx)
    box.append(rdflib.URIRef("http://example.org/some_resource_to_render"))

    # Select a subtree of the RDF graph according to the lenses
    box.select()
    # Apply formats to the tree according to Fresnel formats
    box.portray()
    # Transform resulting data structure to XML
    tree = box.transform()
    # Write XML to a file
    somefile.write(etree.tostring(tree,encoding="UTF-8",xml_declaration=True)

XML output format:

The result of RDFFresnel can be serialized as XML. This is especially
useful if you want to use tools like an XSLT processor for further
processing instead of writing a Python script around RDFFresnel.

The namespace is http://www.andonyar.com/rec/2012/sempipe/fresnelxml
and ft: is usually used as prefix.

Box Model Elements:

    Correspond to Fresnel's box model.

    fresnelresult
        Root element. Corresponds to the class ContainerBox.
        Only contains resource elements.

    resource
        Represents a rendered resource. Corresponds to ResourceBox.
        Can only be contained in fresnelresult and value elements.
        Attribute lens: URI of the employed lens
        Attribute uri: URI of the resource

    property
        Corresponds to PropertyBox.
        Is always a child of resource or label.
        Attribute uri: URI of the RDF property (may be missing)

    value
        Corresponds to ValueBox.
        Contains the value of a property.
        Is always a child of property.
        Attribute type: 'literal' for stings, 'xml' for xml content
        Attribute lang: In case of a literal, contains its language
        Attribute datatype: In case of a literal, contains its datatyoe

    label
        A label of a property or a resource.
        Is always a child of property or resource.

    literal
        Is a child of a value element representing a literal and
        contains its value as string.

Elements with additional content provided by formats:

    These elements may be children of any box model element.

    contentBefore
        Contains the format's fresnel:contentBefore

    contentAfter
        Contains the format's fresnel:contentAfter

    contentFirst
        Contains the format's fresnel:contentFirst

    contentLast
        Contains the format's fresnel:contentLast

    contentNoValue
        Contains the format's fresnel:contentNoValue

Attributes set by formats:

    May be set on any box model element.

    fmt
        Contains the URI of the applied format.

    class
        Contains the value of literals of type fresnel:styleClass from
        the format's fresnel:resourceStyle, fresnel:propertyStyle,
        fresnel:valueStyle, or fresnel:labelStyle property respectively.

    style
        Contains the value of literals of type fresnel:stylingInstruction
        from the format's fresnel:resourceStyle, fresnel:propertyStyle,
        fresnel:valueStyle, or fresnel:labelStyle property respectively.

Running tests:

Run in the source directory

    python3 -m unittest

This automatically looks for all tests in the directory test.
